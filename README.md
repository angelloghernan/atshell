# ATShell

WIP: A shell written in ATS, with full(?) safety features (not including FFI, which can be verified manually easily)

The name is a portmanteau of ATS, Shell, and Hell, the last being the most important because it reflects what it feels like to program in this language when using the full power of dependent types :^)
